**Tic-Tac-Toe Game using JavaScript:**

This is Tic-tac-toe game, which is made by HTML, CSS, JavaScript language.
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game where the objective is to form a line of three symbols (either "X" or "O") horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a 3x3 grid. A player takes turns marking a space on the grid, and the first to complete a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol wins. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

In a JavaScript implementation, you can follow these key steps:

1. **HTML Structure**: Create a 3x3 grid using a simple HTML table or div elements.
2. **CSS Styling**: Style the grid, ensuring each cell is clickable.
3. **Game Logic (JavaScript)**:
   - Store the game state in an array.
   - Track the current player (either "X" or "O").
   - Implement functions to handle player moves, check for winning combinations, and detect a draw.
4. **Event Handling**: Attach click events to the grid cells to allow players to make moves.
5. **Win Condition Check**: After each move, check if there is a winner or if the game ends in a draw.
6. **Reset Functionality**: Add a reset button to start a new game.

JavaScript is used to dynamically handle user interactions, update the game state, and display the result.
